# Hi! I'm Sergio Castro ðŸ’»

I'm an entry/junior software developer from Colombia. I recently decided to return to my path of engineering so I started to study Data Science, 
Python, SQL, and everything that I could find and learn in that path.

## What would you find here?

- I'll publish different repositories with the exercises of every course that I take, according to my progress on these. But, I will not share quizzes, solutions, 
or any assignments from those courses.

- I'll share datasets, databases, or any information necesary to go through the excercises. Although it will be just when the information is public, 
with every link, licence and the necesary metadata.

- If any of the courses has 'Final proyects' I'll share those too.



###### Little disclaimer: I'm from Colombia, so please sorry my English
